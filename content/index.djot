Hey, I’m a software developer who, after work, indulges in coding, typing, cubing, and long-distance running. 

This is my personal website, where I randomly blog what I learned and experienced. The site is powered by my own static site generator engine, with a custom parser to abstract syntax tree and HTML render for the Djot markup language.
