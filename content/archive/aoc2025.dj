# 2025 Advent of Code Summary

Note: the number of problems has been changed from 25 to 12 this year.

```
Day   -Part 1-   -Part 2-
  5   00:03:50   00:06:40
  4   00:04:18   00:08:48
  3   00:03:38   00:09:51
  2   00:05:01   00:23:55
  1   00:02:54   00:12:32
```

## Day 5

1. Brute-force.
2. [Merge intervals](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-intervals/description/).

## Day 4

1. Simulation.
2. Simulation, but multiple rounds.  

## Day 3

1. Brute-force.
2. Treat each row as: "remove some digits so the remaining 12 are as big as possible from left to right". Hint: use monotonic stack. 

## Day 2

1. Brute-force. For each range `(l, r)`, check all integers from 1 up to half the number of digits in `r`, inclusive. 
2. Similar idea, but remember to handle duplicates. For example, `1111` can be represented as `1` repeated four times or `11` repeated two times. 

## Day 1

1. Modular arithmetic.
2. Brute-force.
